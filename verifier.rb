# First, parse the argument, verify that it is a file name and that that file exists.

# Next, read in the file (line by line)?

# Verify if valid

# VALID: Print out addresses and amount of billcoin after completion of chain

# INVALID: Print out the error (what and where).

# Create hash.rb to handle calculating the hash maybe?

# Create validator.rb to do the actual validating

# To validate check:
# That the hash is correct and that the previous hash matches
# That the timestamp has incremented from the previous timestamp
# That, after the entire block is run, no address has a negative balance
# That all addresses are conmprised of 6 decimal digits
# That no invalid characters exist
# That no extra/unexpected characters exist.
